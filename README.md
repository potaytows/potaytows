# Hi I'm Takachi Yakinuma!

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from Khon Kaen University. I have hands-on experience developing mobile applications, most notably "Jonggy", which was my senior project. The app was built using React Native for the frontend, Express.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB as the database. One of the key features of Jonggy is the ability to drag and drop tables, providing a seamless user experience for restaurant table management.

I am fluent in both Thai and English, and I am comfortable communicating and working in either language. Besides React Native, I also have experience developing web and mobile applications using various technologies such as Spring Boot, React, Express, and more. I am passionate about learning new technologies and always eager to improve myself as a developer.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
