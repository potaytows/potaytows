# 👋 Hi, I'm Takachi Yakinuma!

I'm a passionate developer with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from **Khon Kaen University**. I have hands-on experience building both mobile and web applications.

One of my most notable projects is **"Jonggy"**, my senior project — a restaurant reservation app built using **React Native** (frontend), **Express.js** (API), and **MongoDB** (database). A key feature of Jonggy is its **drag-and-drop table layout**, providing a smooth user experience for restaurant staff.
